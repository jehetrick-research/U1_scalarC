in STO/

Copied u1.c_dynmem to pureU1.c.
This should be "good" pure gauge U(1) code.

* Need to test it with a beta loop and look at plaquette. Compare with known results.

Unpacked u1twist_ into TEST/
* had to add /copy u1includes.h into TEST/

* Need to reproduce pure gauge result with w=0.
However, z=0 plane is fixed with no update, so skews <plaq>.

* could write a <PLAQ> measurement that excludes the flux plane


*need to reproduce mag  results
